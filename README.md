# Iris-Flower-Classification
It is part of the Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into species based on their sepal and petal measurements. It involves key steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and deploying the model using Streamlit to create a user-friendly GUI. 

The project utilizes the Iris dataset, sourced from Kaggle, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species of the flowers. The primary goal is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower, providing a practical application of data science and machine learning techniques.
